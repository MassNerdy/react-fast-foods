# React Fast Foods

This is a simple react app that was built with the following criteria in mind:

#### The requirements for the project: 
1. Create a visual menu where the drive-thru employee can select menu items to build the order and then send the order to the cooks. 
2. Handle a case where someone has decided to change their order once they get to the window. 
3. Handle a case where someone has decided to cancel an order once they get to the window. 
4. Have a way to view current open orders and then close them when they're handed to our happy customers. 
5. Alert the manager when the total number of open orders goes above 4. 

Enjoy, and feel free to submit a pull request if you see any areas where improvements could be made.
